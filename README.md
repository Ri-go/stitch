> A height-aware multi-protocol gateway for Cosmos and Injective node fleets.

stitch sits in front of any number of upstream nodes — full archives, bounded
shards, pruned tips — and routes every request to the right one based on
height, hash, or method semantics. Backends fail without taking client
requests with them. Subscriptions resume across upstream restarts with
cursor-deduped continuity. Opt in to multicast and clients on the same
filter share one upstream connection.

## Why stitch

Cosmos archive nodes get unwieldy fast — major chains add several TB per year,
and historical data is read-heavy but write-cold. Operators end up running:

- a small fleet of bounded "shards" each holding a slice of history
- a hot-tier pruned node for cheap latest-block reads
- a full archive as fallback for the long tail
- maybe a DR pair in another region

Doing this with a plain reverse proxy or round-robin LB doesn't work — you
need height-aware routing so a `block(height=12345)` request finds a shard
that actually has block 12345. You also want failover, circuit breaking,
subscription resume, hash-keyed memoization, and broadcast fan-out for tx
submission. **stitch is what you build instead of all of that.**

The two existing projects in this space — `decentrio/gateway` and
`notional-labs/subnode` — each pick one or two of those concerns. stitch is
built from the ground up to do all of them at once, with a clean abstraction
where each piece is independently testable and replaceable.

## Features

- **8 protocol listeners**, all in one process:
  - CometBFT RPC (URI + JSON-RPC over HTTP)
  - Cosmos gRPC (transparent proxy + gRPC-Web)
  - Cosmos REST / gRPC-Gateway
  - EVM JSON-RPC HTTP (8 namespaces, 92 methods)
  - EVM JSON-RPC WebSocket
  - Injective ChainStream gRPC v1beta1 + v2
  - `/injstream-ws` JSON-RPC bridge
  - admin (`/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`, `/admin/*`)
- **Height-aware routing** with overlapping-range coverage shapes (archive,
  bounded, open, pruned). Selector picks narrowest backend that covers the
  request, sparing the archive for what actually needs it.
- **Failover** — circuit breakers per `(backend, protocol)`; transport,
  5xx, dial-error retries; non-idempotent broadcasts skip retry by design.
- **Subscription resume** — kill the upstream mid-stream and the client's
  WS or gRPC subscription survives. Cursor-deduped, monotonic delivery.
  Works for `eth_subscribe newHeads` + `logs`, `injective.stream.v*.Stream`,
  and `/injstream-ws`.
- **Multicast** — N clients with the same canonical filter share one
  upstream connection. Opt-in via `policies.subscriptions.multicast`.
- **Hash → height memo** — `block_by_hash`, `eth_getBlockByHash`,
  `eth_getTransactionByHash`, etc. go from O(N backends) to O(1) lookups.
- **Broadcast fan-out** — tx submission is sent to all healthy backends
  in parallel; first ack wins. No silent drops on partitioned backends.
- **Hedging** — slow primary triggers a parallel attempt on the second
  candidate; whoever responds first wins.
- **Response cache** — finalized historical reads (height ≤ head − confirmation_depth)
  cache for the configured TTL. Idempotent hash-keyed reads cache forever.
- **Hot reload** — `SIGHUP` or `POST /admin/reload` re-reads the config
  and atomically swaps the backend registry.
- **Drain control** — `POST /admin/backends/<name>/drain` removes a
  backend from rotation without dropping in-flight work.
- **Observability** — Prometheus metrics for every dimension,
  structured slog with UUIDv7 request IDs, `${VAR}` env expansion in
  config files.
- **Open source** — MIT, no auth tiers, no quotas, no API keys. If you
  need rate limits or auth, front stitch with your own proxy.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/decentrio/stitch
cd stitch
make build

# Generate a starter config
./build/stitch init -o config.yaml

# Edit config.yaml to point at your upstreams, then run
./build/stitch start --config config.yaml
```

In another terminal:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9091/healthz
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9091/admin/backends | jq
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9091/metrics | grep stitch_
```

## Installation

### From source

Requires Go 1.25+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/decentrio/stitch
cd stitch
make build         # produces ./build/stitch
make install       # or: go install into $GOPATH/bin
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t stitch:latest .
docker run -d \
  --name stitch \
  -p 5001-5008:5001-5008 \
  -p 9091:9091 \
  -v $PWD/config.yaml:/etc/stitch/config.yaml \
  --env-file .env \
  stitch:latest start --config /etc/stitch/config.yaml
```

## Configuration

The config is YAML. All keys use `snake_case`. Unknown keys are rejected at
load time so typos surface immediately.

### Environment variable expansion

`${VAR_NAME}` and `$VAR_NAME` tokens in the YAML are replaced with the value
of process environment variables before parsing. Useful for secrets and
per-environment URLs:

```yaml
backends:
  - name: archive
    endpoints:
      rpc: ${ARCHIVE_RPC_URL}
```

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for a full env file template.

### Listener block

Eight optional listeners. An empty `addr` disables the listener.

```yaml
listen:
  rpc:         { addr: "0.0.0.0:5001" }   # CometBFT URI + JSON-RPC
  grpc:        { addr: "0.0.0.0:5002" }   # Cosmos gRPC (+ gRPC-Web)
  api:         { addr: "0.0.0.0:5003" }   # Cosmos REST
  eth_rpc:     { addr: "0.0.0.0:5005" }   # EVM JSON-RPC HTTP
  eth_ws:      { addr: "0.0.0.0:5006" }   # EVM JSON-RPC WS
  chainstream: { addr: "0.0.0.0:5007" }   # injective.stream.v*
  inj_ws:      { addr: "0.0.0.0:5008" }   # /injstream-ws
  admin:       { addr: "127.0.0.1:9091" } # bind to loopback by default
```

### Backends

Each backend declares its **coverage** — what range of blocks it serves —
and a map of **endpoints** per protocol.

```yaml
backends:
  - name: archive
    coverage: { kind: archive }
    weight: 100
    tags: [archive, primary]
    endpoints:
      rpc:     http://node:26657
      grpc:    node:9900
      api:     http://node:1317
      eth_rpc: http://node:8545
      eth_ws:  ws://node:8546
```

The four **coverage** shapes:

| Kind       | Shape                                       | Example                         |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `archive`  | genesis..head                               | `{ kind: archive }`             |
| `bounded`  | closed interval `[lower, upper]`            | `{ kind: bounded, lower: 1, upper: 50000000 }` |
| `open`     | half-open `[lower, head)`                   | `{ kind: open, lower: 50000001 }` |
| `pruned`   | sliding window of last `keep` blocks        | `{ kind: pruned, keep: 100000 }` |

The selector ranks eligible backends by **specificity** (narrower first),
**health**, and **circuit state**. Within ties, higher `weight` wins. Use
weight to bias a primary region over a DR region; use coverage shape to
spare the archive for cold reads.

### Policies

```yaml
policies:
  failover:
    max_attempts: 3                    # how many candidates to try

                                       # NOTE: hedging currently applies to the EVM
                                       # JSON-RPC (eth_rpc) listener only; the other
                                       # listeners (cmt_rpc included) never hedge.
    methods: [eth_call, eth_estimateGas]   # which methods qualify
                                       # NOTE: hedging is opt-in twice — a method
                                       # hedges only if the built-in manifest flags
                                       # it hedge-safe AND it passes this config.
                                       # An empty list allows every flagged method.
                                       # Non-EVM methods (e.g. abci_query) are inert

### Logging

```

## Concepts

### Coverage and routing

A request like `block?height=12345` hits stitch's CometBFT RPC listener.
The decoder extracts height = 12345. The selector iterates backends:

- `archive` — eligible (1 ≤ 12345 ≤ head), specificity score low
- `shard-1` (bounded 1..50M) — eligible, specificity score high
- `shard-2` (open 50M+) — not eligible (12345 < 50M)
- `hot-tip` (pruned 100k) — not eligible (12345 < head − 100k)

Selector ranks: shard-1 first (highest specificity), then archive. The
forwarder tries shard-1; on success, return. On 5xx or transport error,
tries archive; circuit-records the shard-1 failure. After enough failures
the shard-1 circuit opens and selector skips it entirely until cooldown.

### Subscription resume

When a client opens an `eth_subscribe newHeads`, stitch:

1. Mints a synthetic subscription ID and returns it to the client.
2. Opens an upstream subscription via the same protocol.
3. Forwards each notification with the synthetic ID rewritten in.
4. Tracks a per-client cursor (block number, log index, etc.).

If the upstream dies, stitch:

1. Detects the read error.
2. Re-dials the next eligible backend.
3. Re-issues the subscribe with the original filter.
4. Drops every event whose cursor ≤ last delivered (no duplicates).
5. Resumes forwarding to the client with the same synthetic ID.

The client sees a continuous stream — same ID, monotonic cursor, no gap.

### Multicast (`/injstream-ws`)

Opt-in via `policies.subscriptions.multicast: true` (default off — each
client gets its own upstream connection).

When 100 clients subscribe to the same filter, stitch canonicalizes the
filter (sorted keys, sorted string arrays), hashes it, and uses the hash
as a multicast key. The first client opens an upstream subscription; the
remaining 99 attach to the same upstream. One TCP connection, fan-out
to N clients. A slow client is handled per
`policies.subscriptions.slow_consumer` over its `send_buffer`-sized
queue, and on upstream death the shared subscription resumes within
`replay_timeout` with cursor dedup — no client sees a duplicate.

Subscribe acks are synthesized at attach time: the hub replies
`"success"` immediately and absorbs the upstream's own ack. A filter the
upstream later **rejects** therefore still acks "success" — the client
is then signaled by a WS close (1013, try again later) once the hub
tears the shared upstream down (a rejected filter is never replayed; it
would be rejected again forever). Operators: a "success" ack does not
prove upstream acceptance — watch
`stitch_subscription_dropped_notifications_total{reason="upstream_reject"}`.

In multicast mode `/injstream-ws` serves **only** `subscribe` /
`unsubscribe`; any other JSON-RPC frame is answered with a `-32601`
error instead of per-session passthrough, because there is no per-client
upstream to forward it to (a dedicated passthrough connection per client
would defeat the mode).

### Hash → height memo

`eth_getBlockByHash(0xabc)` doesn't tell stitch which backend has the
block. Without help, stitch would have to try multiple. Instead, stitch
maintains an LRU `hash → height` index, populated by:

- successful responses to height-keyed reads (`eth_getBlockByNumber`, etc.)
- successful responses to hash-keyed reads (`eth_getTransactionByHash`, etc.)

On a cache hit, the hash route becomes a height route — O(1) routing
decision against the right shard.

### Response cache

For finalized reads (height ≤ head − confirmation_depth), stitch caches
the entire response body keyed by `(protocol, method, height, params hash)`.
The next identical call serves from local memory in ~350 ns with no
upstream traffic. Entries live for `policies.cache.ttl` (default 5m);
capacities are bounded by `policies.cache.response_entries` and
`policies.cache.hash_index_entries`.

## Operations

### Admin API

The admin listener serves these endpoints (default `127.0.0.1:9091`):

| Method | Endpoint                                   | Effect                                |
|--------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/healthz`                                 | always 200 if listening               |
| GET    | `/readyz`                                  | 200 once cross-cutting init complete  |
| GET    | `/metrics`                                 | Prometheus exposition                 |
| GET    | `/admin/backends`                          | list all backends + health + circuit  |
| GET    | `/admin/backends/{name}`                   | per-backend detail                    |
| POST   | `/admin/backends/{name}/drain`             | remove from selector (in-flight ok)   |
| POST   | `/admin/backends/{name}/enable`            | undrain                               |
| GET    | `/admin/cache/stats`                       | hash-index + response-cache sizes     |
| POST   | `/admin/cache/purge`                       | drop hash-index + response caches     |
| POST   | `/admin/reload`                            | re-read config; same as SIGHUP        |

Example session:

```bash
# Drain a backend before maintenance
curl -X POST http://localhost:9091/admin/backends/archive-1/drain

# Maintenance happens; in-flight requests finish on archive-1, new
# ones route to other backends.

# Bring it back
curl -X POST http://localhost:9091/admin/backends/archive-1/enable
```

### Hot reload

Edit `config.yaml`, then either:

```bash
kill -HUP $(pgrep stitch)
# or
curl -X POST http://localhost:9091/admin/reload
```

The new backend list takes effect for the next request. In-flight requests
keep their captured snapshot. Drain state persists across reloads — operators
don't expect "drained" to silently flip back when the file changes.

Only `backends` and `log` apply live. Changes to any other section
(`listen`, `policies.*`) are ignored until restart, and the reload logs a
warning naming the ignored sections.

### Metrics

stitch exposes ~15 Prometheus metric families. Hot ones:

```
stitch_requests_total{protocol,method_class,backend,status}
stitch_request_duration_seconds{protocol,method_class,backend}
stitch_backend_health{backend,protocol}                    # 0|1
stitch_backend_lag_blocks{backend}
stitch_circuit_state{backend,protocol}                     # 0=closed,1=half,2=open
stitch_failover_attempts_total{from,to,reason}
stitch_cache_total{layer,result}                           # hashidx|response, hit|miss|evict|expired|purge
stitch_subscriptions_active{protocol,kind}
stitch_subscription_resumes_total{reason}
stitch_subscription_dropped_notifications_total{protocol,reason}  # unknown_sub|slow_consumer|upstream_reject
stitch_relay_truncated_total{backend,protocol}             # upstream died mid-body; client got a partial response
stitch_broadcast_fanout_total{result}                      # success|partial|total_failure|all_circuited
stitch_hedge_wins_total{method,winner_index}               # 0|1
```

### Logging

JSON or text via `log.format`. Every line carries `request_id` (UUIDv7 — sortable),
`protocol`, `method`, `backend` where relevant. Use `request_id` to correlate
client request → routing decision → upstream call → response.

## Performance

Measured on M-series Mac (`go test -bench=.`):

| Operation                              | Latency  | Design target           |
|----------------------------------------|---------:|-------------------------|
| Hash → height index hit                | 204 ns   | < 1 µs                  |
| Response cache hit                     | 356 ns   | P50 < 1 ms              |
| Cache key build                        | 71 ns    | —                       |
| Selector decision (32 backends)        | 780 ns   | —                       |
| Full forward end-to-end (mock)         | 45.8 µs  | P50 < 5 ms              |

A "full forward" measures stitch's added overhead in isolation:
selector → circuit → connection pool → HTTP RTT → header copy → body
relay. Against real upstreams, total latency is dominated by the upstream
node's response time; stitch's contribution stays in the tens of µs.

Validated under chaos:
- 5 mock backends with rolling kills every 50 ms (≥2 always alive)
- 500 concurrent client requests
- **100 % success rate**

## Examples

Ready-made configs in [`examples/`](examples/):

- [`local-dev.yaml`](examples/local-dev.yaml) — single localhost upstream, RPC + admin only
- [`injective-archive.yaml`](examples/injective-archive.yaml) — single archive, all listeners on
- [`sharded.yaml`](examples/sharded.yaml) — bounded shards + open + pruned + archive fallback
- [`multi-region.yaml`](examples/multi-region.yaml) — primary + DR with weighted preference

## Development

### Build & test

```bash
make build              # ./build/stitch
make test               # full suite (~25s)
make test-race          # full suite with -race (~40s)
make lint               # golangci-lint
```

### Contributing

1. `make test-race` must stay green.
2. Add a manifest entry when you add a method (CometBFT RPC, EVM JSON-RPC, or Cosmos gRPC). Tests cross-check the manifest against the [Injective query reference](https://github.com/InjectiveFoundation/injective-core).
3. New listeners follow the `Server` interface contract from `internal/server/lifecycle.go`: `Name()`, `Start(ctx)`, `Shutdown(ctx)`. Eager listener bind in `New()` for race-free `Addr()`.
4. Avoid `fmt.Print*` and the stdlib `log` package — `golangci-lint`'s `forbidigo` enforces this. Use `internal/log`.
